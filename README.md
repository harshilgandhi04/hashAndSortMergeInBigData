# Implementation of Hash Join and Sort Merge Join Algorithm for SPARQL Query Processing

Join Algorithms
Implemented Join algorithms are used on Waterloo SPARQL Diversity Test Suite (WatDiv) dataset. Dateset is being vertical partitioned into tables, that lately are joined to the specific SPARQL query. The project implements Join Algorithms:

Hash Join
Partitioned Parallel Hash Join
Sort-Merge Join

One example of SPARQL query on WatDiv dataset is:

(?a)---follows--->(?b)---friendOf--->(?c)---likes--->(?d)---hasReview--->(?e)
In the query, (?a), (?b), (?c), (?d), (?e) are variables, and follows, friendOf, likes, hasReview are properties. The answer of the query is the list of mapped values of all the variables (?a), (?b), (?c), (?d), (?e).

Obviously, above query can be expressed in the form of SQL given the data set yield by vertically partitioned approach. The corresponding SQL expression is as follows:

SELECT follows.subject, follows.object, friendOf.object, likes.object, hasReview.object
  FROM follows, friendOf, likes, hasReview
  WHERE follows.object = friendOf.subject
        AND friendOf.object = likes.subject
        AND likes.object = hasReview.subject
The query in the form of relational algebra is as follows:

follows join friendOf on follows.object=friendOf.subject
friendOf join likes on friendOf.object=likes.subject
likes join hasReview on likes.object=hasReview.subject
